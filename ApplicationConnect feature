Feature: Application connect
  I want to do multiple validations on connect feature

  Scenario: Login as Admin
    Given user launch the vriti login page
    When user enter the credentials and click on login button
    Then user should able to land on find candidate page
    When user click on View profile button

  Scenario: Send request for connection
    Given I am on other users profile
    When I click on the connect button
    Then Connect button should convert into Request sent
